            <h4>1)var: The var keyword declares a function-scoped or global variable, optionally initializing it to a
              value.
              Function-scoped means that the variable is only available within the function it was declared in. Global
              variables are available throughout your entire code.</h4>
            <h4>2)let: The let keyword declares a block-scoped local variable, optionally initializing it to a value.
              Block-scoped means that the variable is only available within the block it was declared in, which is
              usually denoted by curly braces {}.</h4>
            <h4>3)const: The const keyword declares a block-scoped, immutable constant variable, i.e. a variable that
              can’t be reassigned.
              Constants are also called “immutable variables”, but that’s a bit of a misnomer since they are actually
              variables – just ones that can’t be reassigned.</h4>

            CSS or overriding our default variables. It's also worth noting that just about any HTML can go within the
